Breeder is a website designed to let people playfully explore the principle of artificial evolution. The software is based on the concept of "the Biomorph" as proposed by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Blind Watchmaker. Variables such as the colors, patterns, and movements of abstract visual elements are encoded into an artificial DNA. The visitor can crossbreed the genetic codes of these elements by selecting two of them to produce a new generation. The new generation inherits different genetic traits from both selected parents. Each childâ€™s genetic code is also slightly mutated in order for new genetic traits to arise over the course of multiple generations. This leads to an endless stream of rhythmically pulsating shapes that highlight the poetic beauty of the evolutionary process.

Breeder was created by Eric Parren (http://ericparren.net) using P5.js (http://p5js.org)
